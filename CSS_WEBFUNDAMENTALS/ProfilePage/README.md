## Objectives:
* Use what we've learned about **CSS** to recreate the following website
This is a tricky assignment, let's make sure we build in layers working from the top down and from the outside to the inside.

This assignment may take us upwards of 4 hours to complete, this is normal as **CSS** can be time consuming. **We strongly suggest working in groups**, pair programming is a common programming practice.

We can find the avatar images here: images.zip and the icons are available here: icons.zip

Recreate the look of the top navigation element

Continue building the 2 column layout of this website, start with the rough boxes and add in the images and text as we go
